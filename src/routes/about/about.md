I'm a fan of anime (a Japanese cartoon) since my childhood. My first anime is Digimon Adventure. At that time, every Sunday is a heaven for me because I watch anime series from morning into the afternoon. I still remember the original soundtrack of anime I have watched and I collect it into this site. This site build with SvelteKit, use YouTube IFrame API to load anime original soundtrack YouTube video, and hosted on Netlify.
